A simple Java game. You use the mouse to shoot, A/D to move left/right and space to jump. Right click to use a special ability, but it has cooldown, so save it until you really need it.

You can watch a video of the game here:

You can play it by just downloading and running game.jar. Feel free to download the source and mod it in any way you like :)
